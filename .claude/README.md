# Windsurf IDE Content

This directory organizes content into three categories the IDE can surface:

- `rules/` — Authoritative rules, policies, and long-form source docs.
- `knowledge/` — Curated, concise reference pages that link back to `rules/`.
- `workflows/` — Actionable, short workflows for common tasks.

## How to use

- Add new long-form docs to `rules/`.
- Create short indexes in `knowledge/` that point to the authoritative `rules/` files.
- Add concise, step-wise guides in `workflows/` for day-to-day tasks.

## Indexes

- Knowledge: `./knowledge/README.md`
- Workflows: `./workflows/README.md`
